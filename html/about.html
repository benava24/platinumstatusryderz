        <h2>About US</h2>
    <p>Platinum Status Ryderz (PSR), founded in October 2009, is an all-female motorcycle club driven
        by a passion for safe riding and community service. We are a group of mature, dedicated women
        who not only cherish the freedom of the open road but are also committed to promoting
        responsible, safe riding practices. Our mission is to create a culture of safety, support, and
        empowerment, ensuring that every member rides with confidence and responsibility. Beyond the
        road, we are deeply devoted to giving back to the community through volunteer work, charitable
        initiatives, and service projects that make a difference. At PSR, we believe in the power of
        sisterhood, where women come together to ride, protect one another, and serve the community
        with pride and purpose.</p>
